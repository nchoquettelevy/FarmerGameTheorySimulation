Evolutionary game theory model to investigate the following questions:

1. Under which conditions can formal and informal risk management emerge in a population?

2. How do different assumptions about behavioural and economic preferences alter predicted levels of farmer cooperation on risk transfer mechanisms?

3. How does heterogeneity in farmers' cultural attitudes, preferences, and resources affect the basins of attraction for risk management strategies?
